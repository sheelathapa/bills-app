Create a Spring Boot dashboard — using Thymeleaf
or any UI framework of your choice — that tracks bills with due dates,
shows paid/unpaid status,
highlights upcoming or overdue items
(you may use generative AI to generate code for components, generate sample data).

create a joint account feature.

Have login feature for different users and
login using different users and show the common bills across two users.
